Jake Ross is a PhD candidate working on dating of young volcanic rocks in Antarctica and many aspects of laboratory development.
He has two projects in Antarctic, 1) ANDRILL and 2) Minna Bluff. ANDRILL is a scientific drilling project in Antarctica 
gathering information about past periods of global warming and cooling. Minna Bluff is a related project examining the constructional
evolution of Minna Bluff, a volcanic peninsula 70km to the south of the ANDRILL MIS drill site.

Jake is also the author of Pychron, an open source platform for data automation and processing and RemoteControlServer.cs, a 
C# script for ThermoScientific's Qtegra mass spectrometer software. RemoteControlServer allows client applications such as Mass Spec or
Pychron, to control a mass spectrometer indirectly over the LAN.
