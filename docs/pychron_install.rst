Install Pychron
====================

To use Pychron you need to install both the pychron source files and the
Enthought Python Distribution. 


	#. Install Enthought Python Distribution
		a. `EPD Download <http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php>`_
		b. Enter your ACADEMIC email address (ie, Clark at NMT.EDU)
		c. Follow instructions on webpage. You will receive a download link in your email. Download the 32-bit (x386) version for your operating system.
	#. Go to `Pychron Downloads <http://code.google.com/p/arlab/downloads/list/>`_
		and download the most recent Pychron distribution. As of 6/2012, the most recent version is ``pychron_dist_0.1.zip``
	#. Unzip your Pychron distribution and move contents directly to your home folder
	#. Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilies/Terminal) and run pychron::
		
			$ cd ~/Programming/mercurial/pychron/
			$ python launchers/python.py
			
	#. Pychron defaults to the MDD perspective. The first time you run Pychron, it may be necessary to go to View -> Perspectives -> Reset Perspectives if the windows arenâ€™t showing properly.
